## CodSoft Python Internship Tasks

This repository contains five Python projects completed as part of my CodSoft Python internship. The tasks include:  
1. To-Do List: A simple CLI-based task manager to add, view, and delete tasks.  
2. Contact Book: A Python program to store, update, and search contact information.  
3. Calculator: A basic calculator to perform arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.  
4. Rock-Paper-Scissors: A fun game against the computer with randomized outcomes.  
5. Password Generator: A secure password generator that creates strong, random passwords with user-defined criteria.

Each project demonstrates my Python skills and problem-solving abilities. Feel free to explore and contribute!
